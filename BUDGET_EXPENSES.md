Since there is a very high reward of 100%, we have to raise many costs independently, for this we will use the Tron Loan ($100.000), which Marius Gill received from the Tron Foundation.  
This is divided as follows:
  + 10% Server costs  
  + 25% Administration  
  + 25% Development, Events, Projects  
  + 40% Reserved for additional costs  

Our revenues we get as a representative will be divided as follows
  + 100% Rewards to our voters
  
Starting with the year 2019 we will reduce our rewards to 70%-75%, which will then divided as follows:
  + 70% Rewards to our voters  
  + 10% Server costs  
  + 20% Development, Events, Projects  

The reward to our voters will be reduced over time to add value to development and community projects, as the Tron Loan can only cover this for a limited period.  
Our voters will be informed of any changes via social media to ensure that the rewards are managed as transparently as possible.
