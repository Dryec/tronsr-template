One of our biggest plans is to enlarge the Tron Community, not only with events or meetups, above all with staying in contact with you all the time, keeping you updated via social media, like Twitter or Telegram.  
We want to create a pleasant atmosphere, to give you the feeling of trust and safety within the Tron Society.  
Transparency is very important to us, which is why we want to keep you constantly informed about changes at Tron Society. 

Since you support us, we would like to give something back to you - 90% of all rewards will return to you every day (for more details see our budget expenses)

__The Reward System is officially running since 08.08.2018 and distributes the rewards at 18:00 UTC__

Letâ€™s create a constantly bigger and better Tron Community - __a Tron Society__.
