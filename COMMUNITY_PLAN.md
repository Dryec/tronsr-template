## Our Plans
One of our biggest plans is to enlarge the Tron Community, not only with events or meetups, above all with staying in contact with you all the time, keeping you updated via social media, like Twitter or Telegram.  
We want to create a pleasant atmosphere, to give you the feeling of trust and safety within the Tron Society.  
Transparency is very important to us, which is why we want to keep you constantly informed about changes at Tron Society.

DApp development is also important to us and has a high priority. We have already released 2 Tron Wallets for Android, one Tron Wallet for iOS in planning, one Tron Gamble App released and another one in planning. 

## Our Token
We have also created a token called "TronSociety (TSY)". It serves, beside the votes, as a support for our goals and plans. Each of our voters receives daily TSY in addition to the previous TRX Rewards. The amount is calculated from one third of the TRX Rewards. __From January it can then be exchanged for 1 TRX__.

Since you support us, we would like to give something back to you - 100% of all rewards will return to you every day (for more details see our budget expenses)

__The Reward System is officially running since 08.08.2018 and distributes the rewards at 18:00 UTC__

__From Monday (13.08.2018) - Thursday (16.08.2018) we will increase our rewards from 90% to 200%__

__From Saturday (27.10.2018) - 31.12.2018 we will increase our rewards from 90% to 100%__

__From Friday (23.11.2018) on our Token (TSY) will be distributed daily in addition to the TRX Rewards__

Letâ€™s create a constantly bigger and better Tron Community - __a Tron Society__.
