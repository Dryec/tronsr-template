Tron Society is a group build by some young and experienced people located in Germany and the Tron Community all over the world.  
The Tron Community is already very large, but we are still looking forward to enlarging it.   
Our plan is to invest in dApp development, as well as in Tron network infrastructure by placing more nodes all around the world.  

Tron Society is initially financed by the Tron Loan, which comes from the Tron Foundation.
